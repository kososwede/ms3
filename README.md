# MS3 PROJECT
### This is my third milestone project with CODE INSTITUTE. I have created a website that shows the different things you can see or do on a visit to Stockholm. It uses a database so users of it can Create, Read, Update and Delete different places/activities that have been reviewed.

# UX
### User Stories

The idea behind "Things to do in Stockholm" came from me wondering around Stockholm one day and wondering what to do.
It was very frustrating trying to find where places were and if they were worth a visit. I looked on other travel sites
 but you have to click on alot of links jsut to get to Sweden and then Stockholm, so i created this site that only shows 
 Stockholm so all the info you need will be available right away.

Here you will find a link to my wireframes for this project: https://github.com/kososwede/ms3/blob/master/wireframes/wireframe%20ms3.png

### Strategy

This site was designed for users of any age and who are visiting or planing to visit Stockholm. It will help the users find there way around this amazing city and discover what it has to offer.

### Scope

There should be an easy to navigate landing page so that first time users or anyone not computer or mobile inclined can easily get the information they are looking for with a click of a button or a touch of a screen. The images that will be used for the categories will be easily recognisable so even young children or those who cannot read can navigate to the page they want. There will be a title on the top of each page so that the user knows where they are on the site.

### Structure

This website is structured so that all the relevant places are places in the correct category on their own page:
* MUSEUMS has all the places related to Museums
* PARKS has all the places related to Parks
* ATTRACTIONS has all the places related to Attractions
* ACTIVITIES has all the places related to Activities
* FOOD & DRINK has all the places related to Food & drink
* HISTORY has all the places related to HISTORY

There will be a Navbar that will be at the top of all the pages that will contain links to all the pages so they are easily accessable at all times and all new pages open in a new tab.

### Skeleton

The full screen landing page features the title of my website and underneath that there will be a button to enter the website. The image on my landing page is a beautiful image of Stockholm which fills the screen, it is also the background image of every page on my site.

### Surface

I wanted to keep the website simple and clean so that users eyes are focused on the content. 
I have chosen a an image of Stockholm on all the background pages as it gives you a sense of how beautiful the place is, the navbar is in the same 
colour as the swedish flag (blue and yellow) to keep in the swedish theme. 
On the category select page and the about page i have created a container that has the swedish flag in the background to make it more visually appealing.
