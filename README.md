# MS3 PROJECT
### This is my third milestone project with CODE INSTITUTE. I have created a website that shows the different things you can see or do on a visit to Stockholm. It uses a database so users of it can Create, Read, Update and Delete different places/activities that have been reviewed.
### Here is a link to my website via HEROKU: https://things-to-do-stockholm.herokuapp.com/
### Here is a link to my Code for the above website via GITHUB: https://github.com/kososwede/ms3.git

# UX
### User Stories

The idea behind "Things to do in Stockholm" came from me wondering around Stockholm one day and wondering what to do.
It was very frustrating trying to find where places were and if they were worth a visit. I looked on other travel sites
 but you have to click on alot of links jsut to get to Sweden and then Stockholm, so i created this site that only shows 
 Stockholm so all the info you need will be available right away.

Here you will find a link to my wireframes for this project: https://github.com/kososwede/ms3/blob/master/wireframes/wireframe%20ms3.png

### Strategy

This site was designed for users of any age and who are visiting or planing to visit Stockholm. It will help the users find there way around this amazing city and discover what it has to offer.

### Scope

There should be an easy to navigate landing page so that first time users or anyone not computer or mobile inclined can easily get the information they are looking for with a click of a button or a touch of a screen. The images that will be used for the categories will be easily recognisable so even young children or those who cannot read can navigate to the page they want. There will be a title on the top of each page so that the user knows where they are on the site.

### Structure

This website is structured so that all the relevant places are places in the correct category on their own page:
* MUSEUMS has all the places related to Museums
* PARKS has all the places related to Parks
* ATTRACTIONS has all the places related to Attractions
* ACTIVITIES has all the places related to Activities
* FOOD & DRINK has all the places related to Food & drink
* HISTORY has all the places related to HISTORY

There will be a Navbar that will be at the top of all the pages that will contain links to all the pages so they are easily accessable at all times and all new pages open in a new tab.

### Skeleton

The full screen landing page features the title of my website and underneath that there will be a button 
to enter the website. The image on my landing page is a beautiful image of Stockholm which fills the screen, 
it is also the background image of every page on my site.

### Surface

I wanted to keep the website simple and clean so that users eyes are focused on the content. 
I have chosen a an image of Stockholm on all the background pages as it gives you a sense of how beautiful the place is, the navbar is in the same 
colour as the swedish flag (blue and yellow) to keep in the swedish theme. 
On the category select page and the about page i have created a container that has the swedish flag in the background to make it more visually appealing
to the user.

# Future features

* Login and sign up page,
* Make it so that only the user who added the place/activity can edit there own user name and comments.
* Add different cities insted of just Stockholm.
* More options for the user to add more information like add immages and rate the place/activity.
* making an option for users to add their own category.

* GIT - Used to track changes I have made in my code. https://git-scm.com/
* GITHUB - Works hand in hand with GIT, after files are added and commited to GIT they can be pushed to GITHUB into my repository. https://github.com/
* HEROKU - Whether you're building a simple prototype or a business-critical product, Heroku's fully-managed platform gives you the simplest path to delivering apps quickly.Used in conjunction with GIT and GITHUB. https://www.heroku.com/home
* GITPOD - One-click ready-to-code development environments for GitHub. Used as the environment for my project. https://www.gitpod.io/
* FONT AWESOME - To customise my text. https://fontawesome.com/
* PIXABAY - Used for images in my project. https://pixabay.com
* FLASK - Flask is a popular, extensible web microframework for building web applications with Python. http://flask.palletsprojects.com/

* GOOGLE FONTS - Google Fonts (previously called Google Web Fonts) is a library of 960 free licensed fonts, an interactive web directory for browsing the library, and APIs for conveniently using the fonts via CSS and Android. https://fonts.google.com/

# Testing

My website was tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge. It was also tested on android and ios devices and all worked as it should. A link from GITHUB was sent to my family and friends in England to make sure that it worked on all of their devices. All buttons worked and opened in a different browser window. I was testing my website at every major point in production to make sure everything I was implementing was working and running smoothly. Every button has been tested to make sure that it has the correct reaction. Made sure the add place page cannot be submitted empty and that if a web address is added it is in the correct format.
 My HTML5 CSS3 and my PYTHON code have all been checked in:
* https://validator.w3.org to check HTML5 and returned with no errors.
* https://jigsaw.w3.org to check CSS3 and returned with no errors.
* https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html to check my PYTHON code and returned no errors.

# Deployment

I used GITPOD to develop the site using Python3 and deployed to Heroku via Github.

1. To download or clone the site  you will need to go to my repo, see steps in: https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository
2. Before you download or clone the site you will need to ensure you have Python3 installed.
3. Once you have Python installed, create a virtual environment appropriate to your chosen IDE and os.
4. Run the requirements.txt file as appropriate to your IDE to install the relevant required package dependencies for the project into your virtual environment.
5. Run the app.py file as appropriate to your chosen environment and os.
6. You should now be able to view the site on your localhost on port 5000.
